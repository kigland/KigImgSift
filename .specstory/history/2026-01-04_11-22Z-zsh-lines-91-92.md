<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that the file permissions are `-rw-r--r--`, which means it's readable and writable by the owner, and readable by group and others, but not executable. I need to make it executable with `chmod +x start.sh`.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The script is now executable (permissions changed to `-rwxr-xr-x`), but it's failing when trying to install Go dependencies due to sandbox restrictions. The Go build process is trying to write to the Go cache directory which is outside the workspace. I need to run this with full permissions to allow access to system directories like the Go cache.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that after starting the application, they're getting an error "Failed to load images. Make sure the backend is running." This suggests the backend isn't running properly. Let me check what's happening with the start script and see if I can get more information about the backend startup process.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: start.sh

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the start script is trying to start both backend and frontend. The backend should be running on port 12345. The error "Failed to load images. Make sure the backend is running" suggests the frontend can't connect to the backend. Let me check if the backend is actually running and on the correct port.

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
ps aux | grep -E "(go|main)" | grep -v grep

(eval):1: operation not permitted: ps

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The ps command is blocked by sandbox restrictions. Let me try to check if the backend is listening on port 12345 by trying to connect to it directly.</details></think>
